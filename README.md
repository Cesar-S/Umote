Umote is a universal remote control for TV or other devices that use IR for their remote operation. The software captures the IR codes from an existing remote for the device and associates it with a switch. When the key is pressed the programmed code is transmitted.

The device has 3 modes - Program, Clear and Run mode. 
* Program mode is used to capture the IR code from an existing Remote
* Clear mode is used to delete a previously captured IR code
* Run mode is the default if the others are not enabled.
